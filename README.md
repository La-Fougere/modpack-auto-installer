# Modpack Auto Installer
### For Modpack creators
#### A simple .exe generator to auto install modpack on Minecraft client

Just put the needed content from your .minecraft folder

And if you want, you can add your own exe icon by replacing the file named icon.ico

The player who runs the exe file will be asked for his .minecraft directory if its not the default one and the modpack will be installed.

Also if mods were present before installation, these mods will be deleted
